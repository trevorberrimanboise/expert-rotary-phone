## AI as a Tool for Human Expression
### By Trevor Berriman

#### Introduction
With the meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence in the last 6 months, mainly in the form of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, there has been much speculation about the future of technology and how humanity may evolve. Much of this speculation has focused on enhanced productivity or the various doom-and-gloom scenarios that may occur as AI and robots begin replacing vast swathes of human labor. But I tried to think of the good endings, the endings where man can use this new found power of generative intelligence to create art, culture, and beauty beyond what even the most creative could fathom.
To start my journey into this field, and what this blog post will be about, I focused on OpenAI’s newest iteration of their GPT: GPT-4. I thought of a couple of scenarios where the beauty of the human language could shine and also test GPT-4’s outputs with varying levels of specificity in prompts. The scenario I chose was a love letter to a girlfriend on a sixth-month anniversary. I then created 3 prompts for the scenario, each prompt being more specific and detailed than the last to show the importance or possibly unimportance of prompt engineering. Each prompt was given in the same chat instance and was created prior to inputting them so as to not get biased ideas from the responses themselves. For this blog, I will show the prompt, the response, and then give my analysis on it.
