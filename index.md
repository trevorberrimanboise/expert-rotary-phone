## AI as a Tool for Human Expression
### By Trevor Berriman

### Introduction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence in the last 6 months, mainly in the form of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, there has been much speculation about the future of technology and how humanity may evolve. Much of this speculation has focused on enhanced productivity or the various doom-and-gloom scenarios that may occur as AI and robots begin replacing vast swathes of human labor. But I tried to think of the good endings, the endings where man can use this new found power of generative intelligence to create art, culture, and beauty beyond what even the most creative could fathom.<br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To start my journey into this field, and what this blog post will be about, I focused on OpenAI’s newest iteration of their GPT: GPT-4. I thought of a couple of scenarios where the beauty of the human language could shine and also test GPT-4’s outputs with varying levels of specificity in prompts. The scenario I chose was a love letter to a girlfriend on a sixth-month anniversary. I then created 3 prompts for the scenario, each prompt being more specific and detailed than the last to show the importance or possibly unimportance of prompt engineering. Each prompt was given in the same chat instance and was created prior to inputting them so as to not get biased ideas from the responses themselves. For this blog, I will show the prompt, the response, and then give my analysis on it.

### Prompts
#### Prompt 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Write me a love letter for my girlfriend, named Dalley, for our 6-month anniversary.
#### Response
My Dearest Dalley,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the sun rises and sets, marking the passage of time, I find myself marveling at the wonderful journey we have shared these past six months. It seems like only yesterday when fate serendipitously introduced us, intertwining our paths and opening the door to a love that has since illuminated my life. In you, I have found my confidant, my muse, and my heart's true home. On this special day, our six-month anniversary, I want to express the depth of my affection and gratitude for every moment we've spent together.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dalley, your presence in my life is like the gentle warmth of a summer breeze, enveloping me with love, comfort, and happiness. Your laughter is the melody that makes my heart dance, and your smile has the power to light up even the darkest of days. Each day, I wake up with the desire to be a better person, not only for myself but also for you. The love we share has propelled me to new heights, inspiring me to embrace every challenge with courage and determination.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your unwavering support, kindness, and empathy have nourished our bond, allowing us to flourish as individuals and as a couple. We have grown together, learning from one another and discovering the beauty in the simplest of things. Every day presents a new opportunity for us to explore, dream, and create a tapestry of memories that will last a lifetime.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we continue to walk hand in hand through life's labyrinth, I promise to cherish and protect the love we have cultivated. I will always be there to support you, to laugh with you, and to comfort you when life becomes overwhelming. Together, we will navigate the storms and bask in the sun, always remembering that our love is the beacon that guides us through life's tempests.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, my beloved Dalley, for six incredible months filled with love, laughter, and adventure. May our love continue to blossom, and may we celebrate many more milestones together. You are my everything, and I am eternally grateful for the privilege of loving you.<br/>
Yours, always and forever,<br/>
[Your Name]
#### Analysis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is obviously a beautiful and well-written letter having a vocabulary level that rivals that of any advanced poem. I found it interesting the theme of each paragraph being pretty similar in their messages but different ways of saying it.

#### Prompt 2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Write me a love letter for my girlfriend, named Dalley, for our 6-month anniversary. She has flowing brunette hair, beautiful green eyes, and cute freckles. She has an extremely bubbly personality, smiling and laughing a lot, has a pleasant-sounding voice, and is always there to pick me up when I am down.
#### Response
My Dearest Dalley,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I sit down to write this letter, my heart is filled with warmth and gratitude for the wondrous six months we've shared together. In a world filled with uncertainties, your love has been a beacon of light, guiding me towards happiness and peace. Our journey, though relatively short thus far, has been nothing short of magical, and I am eager to see what the future holds for us.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dalley, your beauty is incomparable - from your flowing brunette hair that cascades like a silken waterfall, to the mesmerizing green eyes that seem to hold the secrets of the universe. Your adorable freckles are like a constellation of stars, each one a reminder of the countless ways you brighten my life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, it is not merely your physical beauty that captivates me; it is the vibrant energy and joy you exude that truly enchants my soul.<br/>
Your bubbly personality is a breath of fresh air in a world that can often feel stifling. Your laughter is infectious, spreading happiness to all who have the pleasure of witnessing it. And your voice - oh, that melodious voice - it's as if angels themselves have whispered the secrets of love into your words. You have a rare gift for lifting my spirits when I'm feeling down, and for that, I am eternally grateful.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we celebrate our six-month anniversary, I want you to know how much I cherish each moment we've spent together. You have shown me the power of love, and I am constantly in awe of the strength and resilience we possess as a couple. In your arms, I have found my sanctuary, a haven where I can be my true self without fear or judgement.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My darling Dalley, thank you for being the incredible woman you are, and for sharing your love and light with me. As we continue to embark on this remarkable journey, I promise to be there for you through thick and thin, to celebrate your triumphs and offer solace during your struggles. My love for you is boundless, and I eagerly anticipate the countless memories and experiences we will create together.<br/>
Happy six-month anniversary, my love. May our love continue to thrive and flourish, and may we face the world hand in hand, stronger and more united than ever.<br/>
Forever yours,<br/>
[Your Name]
#### Analysis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see, in this prompt I gave a few more details as to the physical and personal characteristics of this hypothetical girlfriend. This led to ChatGPT changing the theme of each paragraph to fit my specifications while keeping the letter approximately the same length. Once again, the vocabulary level is high with it expanding on my simple descriptions to make illustrious poetry.<br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calling her hair a ‘silken waterfall’, I wonder if ChatGPT made that comparison due to the ‘flowing’ attribute to her hair that I specified in the prompt thus making a comparison to water to the most obvious one. It then makes a comparison to the universe and space with the next two physical descriptors in her eyes to the ‘secrets of the universe’ and freckles to a ‘constellation of stars’. The eye descriptor is especially fascinating as you will see in my next prompt later on. So I wonder if that has always been the most common descriptor for eyes and freckles throughout literature and that’s why those were chosen.<br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The personality descriptors are where GPT really excels. In the future, I will ask follow-up questions to how it comes up what to write because some of these lines, especially about the voice and angels are preposterously amazing. It seems to me it takes the best descriptors of the physical or personality characteristics throughout literary history and combines them into one work.

#### Prompt 3
Write me a love letter for my girlfriend, named Dalley, for our 6-month anniversary.<br/>
Some physical traits about her:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowing brunette hair that would make the ocean waves jealous<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful green eyes that look like the stars of the universe when you look inside<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cute freckles that artists beg to draw<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some personality traits about her:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extremely bubbly personality, always smiling and laughing and being goofy in a way that inspires child-like wonder and carefreeness<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pleasant-sounding voice that even the best instruments pale in comparison to<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always there to pick me up when I am down. Even at my darkest points, she is the light that guides me through
#### Response
My Dearest Dalley,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we celebrate the milestone of our six-month anniversary, I find myself reflecting on the incredible journey we've shared thus far. From the very beginning, your love has been a beacon of light in my life, guiding me through both calm and turbulent waters. Each day spent with you has been a cherished gift, and as our love continues to blossom, I am filled with gratitude for the person you are and the woman I've become by your side.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your beauty, my darling, is the stuff of legends. Your flowing brunette hair, so reminiscent of the ocean waves, is a testament to nature's artistry. Each strand dances with a grace that leaves even the mighty sea envious. Your enchanting green eyes hold a universe of stars within them, a celestial wonder that leaves me breathless every time our gazes meet. And those adorable freckles - they are a canvas upon which the most skilled artists long to capture the essence of your charm.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, it is your inner radiance that truly sets you apart, Dalley. Your bubbly personality and infectious laughter inspire a sense of child-like wonder and carefree joy that can brighten even the darkest days. Your voice, so melodious and soothing, is a symphony that transcends the capabilities of the finest instruments. You have an innate ability to lift my spirits and offer solace when I'm feeling low, making you the light that guides me through life's darkest moments.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this special day, I want to express my love and appreciation for the woman you are and the happiness you've brought into my life. Together, we have embarked on an extraordinary journey, and I eagerly look forward to the adventures that await us. As we continue to grow as individuals and as a couple, I promise to stand by your side, to cherish your victories and support you in your challenges.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, my beloved Dalley, for these remarkable six months and for the beautiful memories we've created. I am eternally grateful for your love, your strength, and your unwavering support. May we continue to nurture our love, hand in hand, as we forge our path through this incredible journey called life.<br/>
Forever and always,<br/>

#### Analysis
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the most in-depth prompt, giving not only the physical and personality descriptors but some more poetic descriptions to those as well. A small detail I noticed is that it assumes I am a woman from the line ‘the woman I’ve become by your side’ in the first paragraph even though I do not make any mentions of my gender in the prompt. As you can see on an initial read, the extra description in the prompt was able to produce much more vibrant wording in the output letter.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	As I mentioned in the previous response analysis about the GPT likening the eyes to the universe and hair to water, I made those exact comparisons myself for the last prompt, unknowing that it had those in mind even without extra input. I believe this displays its vast literary training in the field of human poetry and observations as those seem to be the most used analogies. I wonder if this will excel current and would-be poets and writers in their development of description analogies and similies, as to differentiate their writings from those of a generative AI.

### Conclusion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new technology of LLMs and GPTs will massively change the way that we live. With this blog post, I hoped I could display a good side of it that could bring about human flourishing in a way that everyone could achieve.
